The pricing for a chatbot system as described—ingesting 400 documents for chat queries, using Azure GPT-4o for the embedding model, text-embedding-ada for text embeddings, and Gemini 2.0 Flash for OCR on scanned documents, supporting 500 users per month—depends on several variable factors. These include the total tokens processed for embeddings and queries, image sizes for OCR, and actual usage patterns. Costs are typically divided into one-time ingestion/setup fees and ongoing monthly usage fees.
I’ll break this down by component based on available pricing data. Note that exact totals require precise usage metrics (e.g., tokens per document or queries per user), which aren’t specified. If these details are unavailable, estimates can be calculated by multiplying per-unit rates by your expected volumes. All figures are in USD and sourced from provider documentation as of the current date (July 22, 2025). Prices may vary by region, volume discounts, or updates—always verify with providers.
1. Document Ingestion and Embedding Costs (One-Time or Initial)
This covers processing 400 documents for embeddings using Azure GPT-4o and text-embedding-ada models. These are typically one-time costs unless documents are frequently re-ingested.
	•	Azure GPT-4o Embedding Model:
	•	Input tokens: $2.50 per 1,000 tokens.
	•	Output tokens: $10.00 per 1,000 tokens.
	•	To estimate: Multiply by the total input/output tokens across all 400 documents. For example, if each document averages a certain token count (not specified here), scale accordingly. This model handles multimodal embeddings, but costs scale with data volume.
	•	Text-Embedding-Ada Model:
	•	Embedding cost: $0.10 per 1,000,000 tokens.
	•	To estimate: Determine total tokens in the 400 documents and apply the rate. This is used for efficient text vectorization.
Total ingestion cost would be the sum of these, potentially ranging from low hundreds to thousands depending on document size and complexity. Without specific token counts, a precise figure isn’t possible—use provider calculators for simulations.
2. OCR for Scanned Documents (Using Gemini 2.0 Flash)
Assuming the 400 documents are scanned images requiring OCR, Gemini 2.0 Flash processes them as image or multimodal inputs.
	•	Gemini 2.0 Flash Pricing:
	•	Input tokens: $1.00 per 1,000,000 tokens (text/audio).
	•	Per image (e.g., 1024x1024 resolution): Approximately $0.00129.
	•	Input audio tokens (if applicable): $0.25 per 1,000,000 tokens.
	•	For OCR on scanned documents, costs are based on image resolution and any extracted text tokens. Grounding or additional requests may add $35 per 1,000 requests beyond free tiers.
For 400 images, base cost could start around $0.516 (at $0.00129 per image), but this increases with higher resolutions or additional token processing. This is likely a one-time cost per batch of documents.
General OCR services (not specific to Gemini) range from $0.006 per minute for transcription to $1.50 per 1,000 pages in comparable tools, but Gemini’s modality-based pricing applies here.
3. Monthly Chat Query Costs for 500 Users
This covers ongoing usage for chat interactions, primarily using Azure GPT-4o for query handling. Costs depend on the number of queries, tokens per query, and user activity.
	•	Azure GPT-4o for Chat Queries:
	•	Input tokens: $2.50 per 1,000 tokens.
	•	Output tokens: $10.00 per 1,000 tokens.
	•	For 500 users, estimate total monthly tokens (input + output) based on average queries per user. Without exact usage, multiply per-token rates by projected volumes.
	•	Overall Chatbot Platform Costs:
	•	Basic AI chatbot plans (suitable for 500 users): $20–$150 per month, covering hosting and basic integrations.
	•	Mid-market plans (with advanced AI like GPT models): $800–$1,200 per month.
	•	Enterprise plans (custom for high volume): $3,000–$10,000+ per month, including scalability for 500 users.
	•	Consumption-based: $0.006–$1 per text/audio request, scaling with user interactions.
For 500 users, monthly costs could range from $625+ (assuming moderate token usage) to several thousand, depending on query volume. Tools like Helicone provide calculators for precise Azure/OpenAI estimations.
Total Estimated Pricing and Considerations
	•	One-Time Costs: Primarily ingestion/embeddings ($0.40–$10,000+ depending on tokens) + OCR ($0.52+ for 400 documents).
	•	Monthly Costs: $625–$5,000+ for 500 users, driven by query tokens and platform fees.
	•	Key Variables and Limitations: Total depends on document token counts, image resolutions, queries per user, and whether costs are pay-as-you-go or subscription-based. If data volumes are high, volume discounts may apply. I couldn’t find exact bundled pricing for this exact combination, so consult Azure, OpenAI, and Google Cloud for integrated quotes. Additional fees may include storage ($0.10/GB/day for files) or fine-tuning ($3.00–$100.00 per model/hour). For a custom setup, development could add $1,000–$10,000 initially.
