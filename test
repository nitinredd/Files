“I have three reagent streams and one quench stream. Pump 1: 0.0526 g/mL CS₂ (MW 108.14); Pump 2: 0.1111 g/mL KOH (MW 76.14); Pump 3: 0.1046 g/mL RB4 (MW 56.11); Quench pump: 0.10926 g/mL water (MW 56.11) with quench factor 1× relative to Pump 2. Compute reaction time as ResidenceTimeT1 × steady-state factor, and calculate flowrates as Equivalence/Molarity fraction of total.”
