Slide Title: RAG vs. Graph RAG: Technical Deep Dive

Subtitle: Advanced retrieval, embeddings, and knowledge graph integration.

Layout:

Left Column (RAG):

Core Mechanism:
Vector Embeddings: Text ‚Üí dense vectors (e.g., SBERT, OpenAI embeddings).
Top-K Retrieval: Cosine/FAISS-based similarity search over chunks.
Hybrid Search: Combine BM25 (keyword) + vector similarity for relevance.
Pipeline:
Chunking: Split docs into text blocks (fixed-size or semantic).
Embed: Encode chunks into vectors (Transformer models).
Retrieve: Query vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) with top-K candidates.
Rerank: Cross-encoder (e.g., MiniLM) to refine final context.
Optimization:
Dynamic chunk sizes | Query expansion | Embedding fine-tuning.
Right Column (Graph RAG):

Core Mechanism:
Graph Embeddings: Entities ‚Üí vectors (Node2Vec, TransE, GraphSAGE).
Multi-Hop Retrieval: Traverse relationships (e.g., Cypher queries in Neo4j).
Subgraph Extraction: Isolate context-rich graph segments.
Pipeline:
Graph Construction: Extract entities/relations (LLM/NLP tools).
Embed: Encode nodes/edges into graph-aware vectors.
Retrieve: Path-based traversal + vector similarity.
Reasoning: Graph neural networks (GNNs) for inference.
Optimization:
Schema alignment | Edge weighting | Hierarchical graphs.

Technical Comparisons (Center Table):

Aspect	RAG	Graph RAG
Retrieval	Top-K vectors + keyword	Graph traversal + embeddings
Embedding Type	Text (SBERT, OpenAI)	Graph (Node2Vec, TransE)
Query Handling	Single-hop	Multi-hop reasoning
Data Structure	Vector DB (FAISS, Pinecone)	Graph DB (Neo4j, TigerGraph)
Key Takeaways (Bottom):

RAG: Speed + scalability for unstructured data; use hybrid search for precision.
Graph RAG: Semantic depth for interconnected data; leverage GNNs for complex QA.
Design Execution:

Colors: Teal for RAG (technical/clean), purple for Graph RAG (complex/innovative).
Icons: Vector DB chip (üñ•Ô∏è), graph node (üîµ), neural network (üß†).
Fonts: Roboto Condensed for headings, bullet points in 10-12pt.
