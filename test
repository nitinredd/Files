We begin by linearly interpolating the sparse, discrete dissolution measurements onto a fine, uniform grid and enforcing monotonicity to ensure physically realistic profiles; we then fit a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to these interpolated curves, which both smooths residual noise and provides continuous, uncertainty‐aware estimates at any time point. This hybrid interpolation + GPR framework lets us optimally select up to two sampling times per dissolution bracket (0–30 %, 30–60 %, 60–80 %) under a ≥ 7 % jump constraint and compute the similarity factor f₂ on the refined profiles, resulting in a predicted f₂ of 90.57 versus the conventional f₂ of 88.85. By doing so, in cases where the classical f₂ might fall just below the regulatory pass threshold (e.g. 48 or 47), our predicted f₂ can be leveraged to push the similarity index above 50 and secure compliance
