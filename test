Hi Team,

Please find attached the Python files for the optimal time point combination.

In brief, the code generates all possible time point sequences with 0 fixed at the start, calculates the f2 similarity metric for each sequence based on regulatory criteria, and identifies the optimal combination for comparing dissolution profiles. It also demonstrates that the f2 score increases with the optimal order-sensitive permutation of time points. I've also included a screenshot for a quick preview.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.

Best,
XYZ
