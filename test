Subject: Overview of Time Point Selection Features and Their Impact on f2

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope you are well.

I am writing to provide an overview of our enhanced time point selection methodology and explain how it affects the f2 similarity metric.

Key Features of the New Time Point Selection Process:

Fixed Zero at the Start:
Our new approach always fixes the 0 time point as the starting element. This ensures that the initial condition is consistently represented in every sequence, meeting regulatory requirements (especially for ANVISA) and preserving the baseline for dissolution curves.
Comprehensive Combinatorial Analysis:
We generate all possible order-sensitive sequences from the available time points (with a minimum of three points and up to the total number of points), but with 0 fixed in the first position. This exhaustive approach (totaling 13,650 sequences for seven time points) allows us to explore every potential combination of time intervals.
Optimal f2 Score Identification:
For each sequence, we calculate the f2 value using the formula:

where

p is the number of time points. The algorithm identifies the sequence that yields the highest f2 value among those that comply with regulatory criteria. Often, selecting a subset (for example, three well-matched time points) results in a higher f2 (e.g., 93) compared to using the full set of time points (e.g., 81). This occurs because the optimal subset minimizes differences between the test and reference curves, even though it represents only part of the full profile.
Graphical Representation:
Once the optimal sequence is determined, the system generates two key graphs:
Full Dissolution Curves: These graphs display the entire dissolution profile for both reference and test products, with vertical markers indicating the selected optimal time points.
Optimal Time Point Curves: This graph plots only the data corresponding to the optimal time points, clearly illustrating the close similarity between the test and reference dissolution behavior.
Why This Matters:

Enhanced Profile Matching: By selecting the most representative time points where the test and reference profiles closely align, we achieve a higher f2 score. This is crucial for demonstrating similarity between products in a regulatory context.
Regulatory Compliance: Our methodology adheres to various regulatory standards (e.g., FDA, EMA, China, ASEAN, and ANVISA) by ensuring that the sequence meets specific criteria, such as the placement of the 0 time point and the behavior of dissolution values at early time points.
Data-Driven Decision Making: The comprehensive analysis of all possible sequences provides confidence that the selected time points are truly optimal, supporting robust product comparisons and potential regulatory submissions.
In summary, the advanced time point selection not only enhances the f2 similarity metric by focusing on the most comparable segments of the dissolution curves but also ensures that the chosen subset is compliant with relevant regulatory guidelines. This balanced approach improves both the scientific robustness and the regulatory defensibility of our dissolution profile analysis.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
