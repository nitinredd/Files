This application addresses the challenge of accurately evaluating drug dissolution profile similarity between reference and generic formulations for regulatory approval, offering an automated solution that calculates the f2 similarity factor, generates dissolution curves with error intervals, and performs compliance checks across multiple regulatory frameworks (FDA, EMA, WHO). By streamlining bioequivalence assessment through automated complex statistical calculations (including bootstrapping for confidence intervals), visualization tools for clear data interpretation, and built-in quality control validations for critical parameters, the tool significantly reduces human error while accelerating regulatory submissions for pharmaceutical developers adapting to various regional guidelines.
