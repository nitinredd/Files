1. Input Format: How You Prefer to Provide Your Requirements
You can submit your calculation request in either plain English or structured Excel format:

Option 1: Plain English Input (Natural Language)

Example Query:
"Calculate the flow rates for a 3-pump system using reactor volume from cell B2 and residence time T1, while considering molar ratios from 'Concentration of reagent (g/ml)' and 'Molecular weight (g/mol)' in the Pump Details sheet."
The system will parse this request, extract the necessary variables, and generate a validated Python script for flowrate computation.
Option 2: Excel-Based Input

You can upload an Excel sheet where each parameter is clearly defined in predefined columns.
This format allows the system to extract numerical values and directly compute flowrates without additional interpretation.
2. Standardized Excel Template Format
To ensure accuracy, please provide input in the following structured format when using Excel:

Sheet 1: Reactor Details

Reactor Name	Volume (ml)	Residence Time (T1)	Temperature (°C)	Pressure (bar)
Reactor 1	250	30	25	1.5
Sheet 2: Pump Details

Pump No.	Reagent Name	Concentration (g/ml)	Molecular Weight (g/mol)	Equivalence
Pump 1	Reagent A	0.8	180	1.2
Pump 2	Reagent B	0.5	150	0.9
Pump 3	Reagent C	0.6	160	1.1
This structure enables our agents to extract values and apply them in the correct formula.

Where:

Reactor Volume is from Sheet 1 (e.g., 250 ml)
Residence Time (T1) is from Sheet 1 (e.g., 30 min)
C₁, C₂, C₃ are reagent concentrations from Pump Details
MW₁, MW₂, MW₃ are molecular weights from Pump Details
Equivalence values correspond to each reagent
The system will automatically extract, validate, and compute the correct flowrate values based on these mappings.

4. Optimization & Additional Calculations
If you need flowrate optimization (e.g., to minimize reagent waste or maximize yield), please specify any constraints in your request.
Additional outputs, such as pressure drop, reaction yield predictions, or mass balance verification, can be enabled based on your experimental requirements.
Next Steps
Confirm Your Preferred Input Format: Do you prefer plain English queries, Excel-based input, or both?
Review & Customize the Excel Template: Let us know if you need modifications based on your lab practices.
Specify Any Optimization Goals: If optimization is required, please provide details on constraints and objectives.
Our goal is to deliver a fully autonomous, accurate, and optimized flowrate calculation system tailored to your needs. Looking forward to your feedback!
