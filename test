What Is Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)?

Definition: ADK is Google’s new open-source framework for building LLM-powered agents and multi-agent systems with under 100 lines of code 
Google Cloud
.
Origin: Announced at Google Cloud Next ’25 to tackle the complexity of end-to-end agent development 
Home- Google Developers Blog
.
Scope: Powers internal Google products (Agentspace, Customer Engagement Suite) now available to developers

.
CLI & Web UI: Built-in developer interfaces for debugging, evaluation, and local testing
Google Cloud
.
Slide 3: Key Features of ADK

Multi-Agent by Design: Compose agents in complex workflows without custom boilerplate

.
Deployment Support: Simple containerization and managed deployment on Vertex AI or any Kubernetes cluster
Google Cloud
.
Slide 4: ADK in the Google Cloud Ecosystem

Vertex AI Integration: ADK agents can be built, deployed, and monitored natively within Vertex AI 
Google Cloud
.
Agent Garden: A repository of sample agents and extension points for rapid prototyping 
Google Cloud
.
Enterprise Controls: Role-based access, logging, and evaluation frameworks ensure production-grade reliability

Slide 5: Overview of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

Purpose: Enables secure, standardized communication between independent AI agents, regardless of framework or vendor
GitHub
.
Open Standard: Public specification with community-driven roadmap and versioning
google.github.io
.
Use Cases: Cross-agency coordination, tool delegation, chaining of specialized agents
Medium
.
Slide 6: A2A Core Concepts

Agent Card: .well-known/agent.json metadata for discovery (capabilities, endpoint URLs, auth) 
GitHub
.
Tasks & Messages: Define units of work (tasks/send, tasks/sendSubscribe) and turn-based communications with Parts
GitHub
.
Artifacts & Parts: Structured outputs (TextPart, FilePart, DataPart) allow for rich inter-agent data exchange 
GitHub
.
States & Lifecycle: Tasks progress through submitted → working → input-required → completed/failed/canceled 
GitHub
.
Slide 7: Integrating ADK with A2A and MCP

MCP Tools in ADK: Agents declare and consume tools via MCP, enabling dynamic API/tool invocation by other agents
google.github.io
.
A2A Endpoints: ADK agents expose A2A endpoints (/run, metadata) out-of-the-box for seamless interoperability 
GitHub
.
Chaining Workflows: Combine ADK’s orchestration with A2A for cross-agent workflows spanning different services and vendors 
Medium
.
Slide 8: Real-World Examples and Samples

Expense Reimbursement Agent: A simple Python example using ADK as an A2A server for finance workflows 
GitHub
.
Multi-Agent Travel Assistant: Sample project demonstrating MCP‐powered flight, hotel, and activity agents with Streamlit UI
