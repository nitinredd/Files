To extract English captions with timestamps from an English audio file, you need a clear and specific instruction that an AI system can follow. Assuming you’re using an AI model capable of processing audio and generating timed transcriptions (such as a speech recognition model like OpenAI’s Whisper), here’s a robust prompt you can use:

---

**Prompt:**

"Transcribe the provided audio file into English text, including timestamps for each segment of speech. Format the output so that each caption is on a separate line, with the start time and end time in HH:MM:SS format, followed by the spoken text. For example:

[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Hello, how are you?  
[00:00:03 - 00:00:05] I'm fine, thank you.

Please ensure that the captions are appropriately divided, with each caption covering a short segment of speech, suitable for use as subtitles."

### Why This Prompt Works:
1. **Clarity**: It explicitly states the task (transcribe audio into English) and specifies the need for timestamps.
2. **Format Specification**: It defines the exact output format (start time, end time, and text) using the HH:MM:SS convention, making it unambiguous.
3. **Example**: The sample output helps the AI understand the expected structure, reducing the chance of misinterpretation.
4. **Practicality**: Requesting "short segments of speech" aligns with typical captioning needs (e.g., subtitles), ensuring the result is usable without being overly granular (like word-by-word timestamps).

### Notes:
- This prompt assumes the AI system can access the audio file (e.g., via an upload or attachment). If you’re using a specific platform, you might need to adjust the phrasing slightly (e.g., "the uploaded audio file").
- If you need a specific captioning format like SRT or WebVTT, you could replace the format description with "Provide the transcription in SRT format," assuming the AI supports it.

This prompt should effectively guide an capable AI system to produce the timed English captions you’re looking for!
