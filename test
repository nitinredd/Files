Hi Karthik,
Thank you for sharing the research paper for evaluation. me and Nishit had multiple discussions internally and are  super game to build this along with you. After thoroughly reviewing it in detail, we must say this is an exceptionally innovative and technically profound work. The application of generative Al, particularly the combination of Continuous-Conditional GANS (CcANs) with the On-Demand Solid Texture Synthesis (STS) architecture, offers groundbreaking possibilities for in silico pharmaceutical formulation and particle engineering.
The ability to synthesize digital formulations with adjustable critical quality attributes (COAs) such as porosity, particle size, and drug loading is transformative. The demonstrated results-like predicting percolation thresholds and simulating drug release profiles highlight the potential to significantly accelerate drug development while reducing costs and experimental dependencies.
To further enhance this work, as outlined in the paper, high-quality imaging data is critical. Specifically, segmented X-ray microscopy (XRM) and FIB-SEM datasets, capturing distinct material phases with high resolution, are essential for robust training. Additionally, expanding this framework with diffusion models such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models where a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium thermodynamics could give us optimal results by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics could further improve the fidelity and diversity of synthesized structures, enabling even more precise extrapolation and analysis of COAs. 
we are eager to explore how we can advance these methodologies further. and we look forward to contributing further through additional evaluation and further discussions.
Best Regards, 
Nitin Reddy
